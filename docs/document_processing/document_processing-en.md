# What is chunking, and why do we chunk our data?

Chunking is the process of breaking down large textual datasets or documents into smaller, semantically meaningful segments called chunks. These chunks typically range from 50 to 2,000 tokens and align with natural language boundaries like paragraphs, sections, or logical groupings.  

**Primary purposes of chunking:**  
- **Overcome Context Window Limits**: LLMs have fixed token capacities (e.g., 4K–128K). Chunking ensures inputs fit within these constraints.  
- **Precision Retrieval**: Vector databases return more relevant results when matching smaller coherent units rather than entire documents.  
- **Preserve Semantic Context**: Unified chunks maintain topic integrity (e.g., one chunk = one concept explanation).  
- **Optimize Computation**: Processing smaller segments reduces memory overhead and latency in embedding generation.  
- **Mitigate Information Noise**: Isolating key content minimizes irrelevant text that could cause hallucinations in RAG outputs.  
- **Enable Parallel Processing**: Smaller units allow concurrent indexing/retrieval operations.

# What factors influence chunk size?

Chunk size optimization balances technical constraints and domain requirements:  
1. **LLM Context Capacity**: Target model's max token limit (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo: 128K, Claude 3: 200K).  
2. **Embedding Model Performance**: Models like `text-embedding-ada-002` work best with 256–1,536 token chunks.  
3. **Information Density**:  
   - Technical/Scientific Content → Smaller chunks (200–500 tokens) for precision.  
   - Narrative/Descriptive Text → Larger chunks (800–1,500 tokens) for context.  
4. **Downstream Task Objectives**:  
   - Question Answering → Small chunks (≤256 tokens) for pinpoint retrieval.  
   - Summarization → Larger chunks (≥1024 tokens) for holistic understanding.  
5. **Query Complexity**:  
   - Specific Fact Retrieval → Smaller chunks.  
   - Conceptual/Thematic Queries → Larger chunks.  
6. **Document Structure**: Header hierarchy, paragraph length, and table/list prevalence dictate natural boundaries.  
7. **Retrieval Performance**: Smaller chunks improve recall; larger chunks enhance relevance. Metrics testing determines optimal balance.  
8. **Language Characteristics**: Agglutinative languages (e.g., German) require adaptive tokenization vs. analytical languages (e.g., English).

# What are the different types of chunking methods?

Five principal chunking strategies with distinct use cases:  
1. **Fixed-Size Chunking**:  
   - Splits text at predetermined token counts (e.g., 512 tokens).  
   - *Pros*: Simple implementation, consistent metadata.  
   - *Cons*: Ignores semantic boundaries, disrupts tables/lists.  

2. **Semantic Boundary Chunking**:  
   - Splits at natural breaks:  
     - Sentence endings (using `spaCy`/NLTK).  
     - Paragraph breaks (`\n\n`).  
     - Section headers (`<h1>`–`<h6>` in HTML/Markdown).  
   - *Pros*: Preserves context coherence.  
   - *Cons*: Variable chunk sizes requiring metadata tracking.  

3. **Recursive Chunking**:  
   - Hierarchical splitting: section → paragraph → sentence until size targets met.  
   - *Tools*: `LangChain` RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.  

4. **Content-Aware Chunking**:  
   - Specialized handlers for document elements:  
     - **Table Chunking**: Treats tables as atomic units.  
     - **List Grouping**: Preserves entire bulleted/numbered lists.  
     - **Code Block Retention**: Keeps code snippets intact.  

5. **Sliding Window (Overlapping) Chunking**:  
   - Adds 10–15% token overlap between consecutive chunks.  
   - *Use Case*: Mitigates context fragmentation at boundaries.  
   - *Trade-off*: Increases index size by ~20%.  
### Examples of Different Chunking Methods

### 1. Fixed-Size Chunking (512 tokens)
**Document:** Research paper on climate change (3,200 tokens)  
**Chunking Process:**  
```
Chunk 1: Tokens 1-512 (Introduction section)  
Chunk 2: Tokens 513-1024 (Methodology part A)  
Chunk 3: Tokens 1025-1536 (Methodology part B)  
Chunk 4: Tokens 1537-2048 (Results section)  
Chunk 5: Tokens 2049-2560 (Discussion part A)  
Chunk 6: Tokens 2561-3072 (Discussion part B)  
Chunk 7: Tokens 3073-3200 (Conclusion)
```
**Notice:** Methodology section split unnaturally between chunks 2 and 3

### 2. Semantic Boundary Chunking
**Document:** Technical documentation with headings  
**Chunking Process:**  
```
# API Reference
Chunk 1: [Heading-based chunk]
Endpoint: /users  
Methods: GET, POST  
Parameters: limit, offset  

# Authentication
Chunk 2: [Heading-based chunk]
OAuth2 flow requires...  

## JWT Tokens
Chunk 3: [Subheading-based chunk]
Token expiration: 3600s...

# Error Codes
Chunk 4: [Heading-based chunk]
400: Invalid request...
```
**Notice:** Chunks respect heading hierarchy (H1 → H2)

### 3. Recursive Chunking
**Document:** Legal contract (Section → Paragraph → Sentence)  
**Chunking Process:**  
```
Stage 1: Split by sections
[Chunk A: Definitions]  
[Chunk B: Obligations]  
[Chunk C: Termination]

Stage 2: Split Chunk B by paragraphs
[Chunk B1: Payment Terms]  
[Chunk B2: Delivery Schedule]  
[Chunk B3: Quality Standards]

Stage 3: Split Chunk B1 by sentences
[Chunk B1a: "Payments due net 30..."]  
[Chunk B1b: "Late payments incur 1.5% monthly interest..."]
```
**Notice:** Hierarchical splitting preserves context at each level

### 4. Content-Aware Chunking
**Document:** Software documentation with code snippets  
**Chunking Process:**  
```
[Text chunk]  
To install the package:  

[Code chunk - preserved intact]  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
npm install package-name  

[Text chunk]  
Configuration requires:  

[List chunk - preserved intact]  
1. Set API_KEY environment variable  
2. Configure database settings  
3. Enable security protocols  

[Table chunk - preserved intact]  
| Setting    | Default | Required |  
|------------|---------|----------|  
| timeout    | 30s     | No       |  
| retries    | 3       | Yes      |
```
**Notice:** Different element types handled appropriately

### 5. Sliding Window Chunking (with 20% overlap)
**Document:** Novel chapter  
**Chunking Process:**  
```
Chunk 1 (Tokens 1-500):  
"The moon cast long shadows... [story continues]"  

Chunk 2 (Tokens 400-900):  
"...continued from previous chunk [overlap]... 
The character entered the dark forest..."  

Chunk 3 (Tokens 800-1300):  
"...forest path wound deeper [overlap]... 
A mysterious figure appeared suddenly..."
```
**Notice:** Overlapping tokens ensure context continuity at boundaries

# How to find the ideal chunk size?

Employ iterative, metrics-driven testing:  
1. **Benchmark Dataset**:  
   - Curate 50–100 representative queries with ground-truth answers.  
   - Use diverse document samples from target corpus.  

2. **Embedding & Retrieval Test**:  
   - Index chunks of candidate sizes: {128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048} tokens.  
   - For each query:  
     - Retrieve top-5 chunks per size group.  
     - Calculate metrics:  
       - Recall@k (% relevant chunks in results)  
       - Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of first relevant hit  

3. **Generation Quality Assessment**:  
   - Pass top-3 retrieved chunks to LLM for answer synthesis.  
   - Evaluate outputs using:  
     - Hallucination rate (via `fact_score` tools)  
     - Context faithfulness (RAGAS `answer_relevance`)  
     - BLEU/ROUGE against ground truth  

4. **Hybrid Sizing Strategy**:  
   - When small chunks yield high recall but poor answer quality:  
     - Use 256–512 token chunks for retrieval.  
     - Expand to parent 1024-token chunks during synthesis.  

### Hybrid Chunk Size Strategy Example

### Scenario Background
Medical knowledge base Q&A system, user query:  
"What are the contraindications for beta-blockers in treating angina?"

### Problem with Small Chunk Strategy (256 tokens)
**Retrieval Results**:  
1. Chunk A (256t): "Beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand by lowering heart rate..."  
2. Chunk B (256t): "Common contraindications include bradycardia (HR<50bpm)..."  
3. Chunk C (256t): "Contraindicated in bronchial asthma as may induce bronchospasm..."  

**LLM Generated Answer**:  
"Contraindications: bradycardia, bronchial asthma"  
*Problem: Misses critical contraindications (hypotension, heart failure) as relevant chunks weren't retrieved*

### Hybrid Size Strategy Implementation

#### Step 1: Hierarchical Chunk Storage
```
# Document preprocessing example
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Small chunks (for retrieval)
small_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=256,
    chunk_overlap=25
)

# Large chunks (for generation)
large_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1024,
    chunk_overlap=100
)

# Create mapping
chunk_mapping = {}
for doc in documents:
    small_chunks = small_splitter.split_text(doc.content)
    large_chunks = large_splitter.split_text(doc.content)
    
    # Map small→parent chunks
    for small in small_chunks:
        parent = find_parent_chunk(small, large_chunks)
        chunk_mapping[small.id] = parent.id
```

**Toolkit**: `chroma` (testing), `llama-index` (experimentation), `ragas` (evaluation).

# What is the best method to digitize and chunk complex documents like annual reports?

A 5-stage pipeline optimized for structured data:  
1. **Digitization**:  
   - Toolstack: `Tesseract` + `LayoutParser` OR AWS Textract for OCR.  
   - Preserve layout features: coordinates, fonts, hierarchy.  
   - Output: HTML/Markdown with structural tags.  

2. **Document Segmentation**:  
   - Section Identification:  
     - Identify covers, ToC, MD&A, financial statements, footnotes.  
   - Metadata tagging: `section_type`, `page_num`, `year`.  

3. **Element-Specific Processing**:  
   - **Tables**: Extract as HTML with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`.  
   - **Lists**: Parse nested hierarchies using indentation/numbers.  
   - **Images**: Store original files + OCR alt-text.  
   - **Footnotes**: Link to source markers in text.  

4. **Hierarchical Chunking**:  
   - Phase 1: Split at major sections (e.g., "Financial Statements").  
   - Phase 2: Recursive chunking within sections:  
     - Group tables/lists as atomic units.  
     - Split text: paragraph → 2–3 paragraph clusters (300-700 tokens).  
     - Apply 10% token overlap.  

5. **Semantic Enrichment**:  
   - Generate chunk summaries (using `gpt-3.5-turbo`).  
   - Cross-reference related items (e.g., chart ↔ analysis text).  

**Production Tools**: `unstructured.io`, `pymupdf`, AWS Textract.

# How to handle tables during chunking?

Five key principles for tabular data:  
1. **Atomicity Principle**: Never split tables across chunks – treat as single units.  
2. **Structure Preservation**:  
   - Convert to formats maintaining relationships:  
     - HTML: Retains headers via `<th>`, cell alignments.  
     - Markdown: Simplified readability.  
   - Tools: `tabula-py`, `pdfplumber`.  
3. **Semantic Context**:  
   - Prepend caption above table: "Table 3: Quarterly Revenue (2020-2023)".  
   - Append adjacent descriptive text when <50 tokens.  
4. **Metadata Embedding**:  
   ```json  
   {  
     "element": "table",  
     "columns": ["Quarter", "Revenue", "YoY Growth"],  
     "dimensions": "4x3",  
     "context_section": "Financial Results Q3"  
   }  
   ```
5. **Fallback Strategies**:
   - For parsing failures:
   - OCR snapshot → GPT-4V description.
   - Flatten to key-value pairs: "Q1 Revenue: $1.2M".

# How do you handle very large table for better retrieval?

Handling oversized tables requires specialized techniques to maintain data integrity and retrieval efficiency:

1. **Semantic Segmentation**  
   - Vertical partitioning: Divide columns into logical groupings (e.g., financial metrics vs operational KPIs)  
   - Horizontal chunking: Group rows by semantic categories (e.g., cluster "Q1 Results" rows separately from "Q2 Results")  

2. **Metadata Enrichment**  
```
{
    "table_type": "financial_quarterly",
    "key_columns": ["Revenue", "Gross Margin"],
    "time_range": "2023 Q1-Q4",
    "summary_stats": {
        "Revenue": {"min": 1.2, "max": 2.1, "avg": 1.6, "unit": "M USD"},
        "EPS": {"range": [0.15, 0.22]}
    }
}
```

3. **Hierarchical Indexing Architecture**  
Create three-tier vector embeddings:  
1. Schema Embedding: Column headers + data types  
2. Statistical Embedding: Min/max/avg/stdev values  
3. Sample Embedding: First/last 3 representative rows  

4. **Query-Optimized Retrieval**  
```
graph TD
  A[User Query] --> B{Query Type Classifier}
  B -->|Fact Lookup| C[Column-specific Index]
  B -->|Trend Analysis| D[Statistical Index]
  B -->|Detail Retrieval| E[Segmented Data Index]
```

# How to handle list item during chunking?

Effective list processing requires semantic-aware strategies:

1. **Atomic List Integrity**  
   - Preserve complete lists: Never split across chunks  
   - Minimum threshold: Treat ≥5 items as standalone chunks  

2. **Structure Preservation**  
```
- Main Category
  • Sub-item A
  • Sub-item B
    ◦ Nested detail
```

3. **Length-Based Handling**  
| **Items** | **Strategy**              | **Example**                     |  
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| 1-3       | Embed in paragraph        | Included in context chunks      |  
| 4-10      | Standalone chunk          | "Product features" list chunk  |  
| 10+       | Thematically grouped      | "Technical specifications"      |
